# FinTech Module 21 Challenge: Fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted


In this challenge we:

 - Created the KaseiCoin token contract.
 - Created the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.
 - Created the KaseiCoin deployer contract.
 - Performed a real-world, pre-production test of your crowdsale. In order to do so, you will deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
 - Recorded a short video or take several screenshots that show the deployed contract in action.
 - Optional: Used OpenZeppelin to extend the functionality of your crowdsale contract by adding time restrictions, refund capabilities, and a cap for the number of tokens that may be created.
